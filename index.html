<h1> Has Pollution in NYC Decreased? </h1>

<body>
    <!-- YOUR CONTENT GOES HERE -->
  <p> Since 2003, air quality advisory warnings in New York City have decreased, despite rising global temperatures and pollution. During the summer months, the National Weather Service occasionally issues warnings about spending time outside because of high pollution and excessive heat.  </p>



<p> Strenuous outdoor physical activity is discouraged during an air quality alert. Any number over 100 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, which includes young children, older adults, people with lung or heart disease and people with lower socioeconomic status, according to the EPA.
 </p>

<iframe title="Air quality advisories dropped between 2006 and 2009" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-M4dEd" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/M4dEd/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<p> Because of increased tree coverage, which traps and stores carbon, along with heavy rain, the city has seen fewer air quality advisories. The city’s urban forest has multiplied since the start of MillionTreesNYC, which plants street trees around NYC neighborhoods. A series of La Niña events and a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation contributed to cooler temperatures. </p>
